## Personal Portfolio

This is my Personal Portfolio. I decided to try Next.js so that way I could gain more knowledge of React and this Framework. I had to do a lot of research into styled components in order to get the page to look they way I wanted , but I'm thinking of possibly changing the color scheme and animation.
